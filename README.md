Everything in the [**Ripped Guide**](https://ripped.guide), mirrored here for Suggestions and Improvements.

**Be sure to check in the repo if anything you're about to suggest is already inside.**

# How to Contribute?

Simply make an Issue with a brief description of your Suggestion  
  
_or_ 

Make a Pull Request with the modified/added Content.  

**We do not recommend randomly forking the repo, just for the sake of renaming it and keeping it on your profile, instead star it.   
*Only fork when necessary and delete your repo after your Pull Request was Approved/Denied.*  
This is to prevent any outdated info from being kept, as we may remove sites that turned malicious or went down.**
