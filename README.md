# How to Contribute?

Simply make an Issue with a brief description of your Suggestion  
  
_or_ 

Make a Pull Request with the modified/added Content.  

**We do not recommend randomly forking the repo, just for the sake of renaming it and keeping it on your profile.   
*Only fork when necessary and delete your repo after your Pull Request was Approved/Denied.*  
This is to prevent any outdated info from being kept, as we may remove sites that turned malicious or went down.**
